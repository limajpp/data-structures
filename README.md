<h1 align="center">Overview:</h1>
<p>
    This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in Java. Each data structure is built from scratch, avoiding Java's built-in collections, to ensure a deep understanding of how these structures work internally. These implementations are ideal for students, developers preparing for coding interviews, or anyone looking to strengthen their computer science fundamentals.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DoublyLinkedList</strong>: A linked list where each node points to both its previous and next nodes.</li>
    <li><strong>DynamicStack</strong>: A stack implementation that dynamically adjusts its capacity as elements are pushed or popped.</li>
    <li><strong>HashTable</strong>: Key-value storage using hashing for efficient lookups.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkedList</strong>: A singly linked list implementation supporting insertion, deletion, traversal, and search operations.</li>
    <li><strong>List</strong>: A general linear data structure offering sequential access to elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Queue</strong>: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) implementation with enqueue and dequeue operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Stack</strong>: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure supporting push, pop, and peek operations.</li>
    <li><strong>UnorderedPriorityQueue</strong>: A priority queue implementation without strict ordering rules for insertion.</li>
</ul>
